  trap_chance:
    # The probability for each filler item (including unique filler) to be replaced with a trap item.
    # The exact number of trap items will still be somewhat random, so you can't know
    # if you've seen the 'last trap' in your world without checking the spoiler log.
    # If you don't want any traps, set this to 0.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
