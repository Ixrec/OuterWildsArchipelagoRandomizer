  # Options specific to Outer Wilds

  goal:
    # The victory condition for your Archipelago run. Goals involving the Prisoner require enable_eote_dlc to be true.
    # 
    # Song of Five:         Reach the Eye
    # Song of the Nomai:    Reach the Eye after meeting Solanum
    # Song of the Stranger: Reach the Eye after meeting the Prisoner
    # Song of Six:          Reach the Eye after meeting either Solanum or the Prisoner
    # Song of Seven:        Reach the Eye after meeting both Solanum and the Prisoner
    # Echoes of the Eye:    Meet the Prisoner and complete the DLC

  spawn:
    # Where you wake up at the start of each loop.
    # 
    # 'vanilla' is the same as the base game: you wake up in TH Village, talk to Hornfels to get the Launch Codes, then walk by the Nomai statue to start the time loop.
    # All other options (including timber_hearth) will spawn you in your spacesuit, with the time loop already started, and the Launch Codes item placed randomly like any other AP item.
    # stranger of course requires enable_eotc_dlc to be true.
    # 
    # The idea is that non-vanilla spawns will require you to play "shipless" for a while, possibly using Nomai Warp Codes to visit other planets. The ship will still spawn nearby, so you can use the ship log/tracker right away.
    # When playing with non-vanilla spawns, we recommend:
    # - Consider enabling randomize_warp_platforms for greater variety if you get warp codes early
    # - Consider using early_key_item, especially in non-solo games
    # - Install a fast-forward mod such as Alter Time or Cheat And Debug Mod, since you may need to do a lot of waiting for e.g. Ash Twin sand or Giant's Deep islands

  early_key_item:
    # Ensure that one of Translator, Nomai Warp Codes, Launch Codes, or Stranger Light Modulator will be somewhere
    # in sphere 1 and in your own world, guaranteeing you can find it without waiting on other players.
    # 
    # `any` will randomly select one of these items that's relevant to your spawn (especially useful with `spawn: random`).
    # For base game spawns it will choose Translator, NWC or LC, and for stranger spawns it will choose LC or SLM.
    # If split_translator is also on, then "Translator" means the one for your spawn planet.
    # 
    # Recommended for games with non-vanilla spawns, especially async games.
    # In addition, without this AP seems to almost always put Launch Codes in sphere 1, so `any` also helps increase variety.

  enable_eote_dlc:
    # Incorporates Echoes of the Eye content into the randomizer with an additional 10 items and 34 locations.
    # If logsanity is enabled, that will add another 72 locations, for a total of 106 DLC locations.
    #

    # so you can fly there without repeating the satellite puzzle (once you have Launch Codes).

  dlc_only:
    # Sets enable_eote_dlc to true, spawn to stranger, goal to echoes_of_the_eye (see descriptions of those options),

    # Not compatible with story mods.

  randomize_orbits:
    # Randomizes:
    # - The order of the five planets (the Hourglass Twins as a whole, Timber Hearth, Brittle Hollow, Giant's Deep, Dark Bramble), i.e. which ones are closer or farther from the sun
    # - The orbit angles of the five planets, as well as four satellites (Sun Station, Attlerock, Hollow's Lantern, and the Orbital Probe Cannon)

    'true': 50

  randomize_rotations:
    # Randomizes the axes of rotation for Ember Twin, Ash Twin, Timber Hearth and Brittle Hollow.
    # 
    # This often causes the Hourglass Twins' sand pillar to pass through different areas,
    # and structures inside the ATP to move differently (becoming a hazard for the player).
    'false': 0

  randomize_warp_platforms:
    # Randomize which Nomai warp platforms are connected to each other.

    'true': 0

  randomize_dark_bramble_layout:
    # Randomizes which Dark Bramble 'rooms' link to which other rooms, so you can't rely on your memory of the vanilla layout.
    # Be aware that randomized layouts are often significantly harder to navigate than vanilla Dark Bramble, since they allow several paths to the same room and more complex loops / recursion.
    # 'hub_start' forces the first room to be Hub (same as the vanilla game), which tends to generate shorter and simpler paths than full randomization.

  trap_chance:
    # The probability for each filler item (including unique filler) to be replaced with a trap item.
    # The exact number of trap items will still be somewhat random, so you can't know
    # if you've seen the 'last trap' in your world without checking the spoiler log.
    # If you don't want any traps, set this to 0.

  logsanity:

  shuffle_spacesuit:
