// SignalscopeManager.cs deals with the player having and equipping the Signalscope itself.
// This file is about individual signals and frequencies, and how the Signalscope's UI is
// changed to support signal and frequency items for AP.

// In the vanilla game, "have I scanned X with the Signalscope?" and
// "do I know X's frequency + signal?" are always both true or both false.
// To randomize frequencies and signals, we need to separate those two concepts.

// We use the term "scanned" for frequencies and signals that the player has pointed the
// Signalscope at and are stored in the vanilla save file.
// We use the term "usable" for frequencies and signals that the player has received the
// Archipelago items for, and thus our mod wants to allow the use of.
